# DataStructures_FinalProject

We were tasked to store a list of 10,000 IDs 3 different ways; Using a Double Linked List, Hash Table with BST Chaining, and Hash Table with Double Hashing. 
To check the time complexity, we calculated the time it takes to insert and search for IDs stored in each data structure. We did this by:

    Inserting 200 IDs -> Searching 200 IDs -> Repeat (50 times)
    
This way we could evaluate the time complexity of each data structure as the number of IDs stored increased. 
We also check the number of collisions the Hash Tables have as the # of IDs stored increases.
